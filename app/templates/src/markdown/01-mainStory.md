### Markdown refresher

**This is bold text**

**This is italic text**

This contains some inline $$$\frac {a + 3} {b + c}$$$ latex text

An equation can be written as follow:

$$
\begin{align}
a + b &= 3 \\
b &= 3 - a
\end{align}
$$

Writing some `inline code` or perhaps functions:

	function() {
		console.log("hello world");
	}

Oh, and HTML tags are supported as well.

### Where are all 'em Markdown files?

Dive into the `src/markdown/` folder.  These are concatenated at runtime, sorted alphabetically by filename.
